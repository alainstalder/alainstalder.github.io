/**
 * Mode for loading classes.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The traditional way to load classes in the Java VM is &quot;parent first&quot;,
 * while &quot;current first&quot; is a newer approach to load classes, which, for example,
 * servlet containers or similar applications use in some cases.
 * Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The &quot;parent first&quot; approach is maybe often better in more static situations,
 * while &quot;current first&quot; is maybe often better in more dynamic situations,
 * like maybe also often with dynamically compiled Groovy scripts.
